In case of PWM Control Mode, both PID controller and Feedforward controller are deactivated while [Goal PWM(100)] value is directly controlling the motor through an Inverter. In other control modes, this value is used to limit PWM value. This value cannot exceed [PWM Limit(36)]. Please refer to the Gain section in order to see how [Goal PWM(100)] affects to different control modes.

| Range  | Description |
| :----: | :---------: |
| -[PWM Limit(36)] ~ [PWM Limit(36)] | Initial Value of [PWM Limit(36)] : ‘885’ |
