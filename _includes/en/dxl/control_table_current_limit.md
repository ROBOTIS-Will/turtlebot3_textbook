This value indicates maximum current(torque) output limit. [Goal Current(102)] canâ€™t be configured with any values exceeding [Current Limit(38)]. The [Current Limit(38)] is used in Torque Control Mode and Current-based Position Control Mode, therefore decreasing [Current Limit(38)] will result in decreasing torque of DYNAMIXEL. For more details, please refer to the Position PID Gain(80 ~ 84).
