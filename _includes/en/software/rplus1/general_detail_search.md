- DYNAMIXEL connected at other speeds are not found.  
 
##### Detailed Search
- Search for DYNAMIXEL connected at every possible communication speed.

**NOTE** : If a DYNAMIXEL is no longer detected after a detailed search, there might be an ID duplication. In this case, connect only the undetected device, and change its ID to an unused one. (Refer to the [Change ID of DYNAMIXEL].)
