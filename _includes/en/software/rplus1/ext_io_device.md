The controller supports exterior I/O devices, such as IR sensors, touch sensors, and DMS sensors.
 
##### Characteristics

- Most devices support only reads, but a few also allow writes.
- After connecting and setting up an exterior I/O device, you can check its values.
- For user's devices, you can set which values are returned.
- Exterior I/O devices are not recognized automatically, so the user must manually set the device.
- IR sensors, touch sensors, DMS Sensors, and user's devices are supported.
- If you read without connecting a device, a random value will be returned. This value is meaningless.
- When the port and device are set, the address will be set automatically. This address can be used during programing.
