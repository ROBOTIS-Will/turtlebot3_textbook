Sounds can be detected using the microphone in the controller.
 
##### Characteristics

- When a sound louder than a certain threshold, such as a clap, is made near the controller, it will be detected by the controller's microphone.  
- The maximum number of sounds counted is 255.
- When sounds are no longer detected, the number of detected sounds will be input into the "Sound Count" parameter.
- Because "Sound Count" is not initialized automatically, the user must reset it to 0 before use.
