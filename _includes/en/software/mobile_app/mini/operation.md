**NOTE** : The ROBOTIS-MINI app uses smart device’s functions such as the button, gesture (sensor), voice recognition, and messenger to play motions.
{: .notice}

- **Button** : Use the buttons on your screen to operate the ROBOTIS-MINI.
- **Gesture** : Move the smart device to make particular gestures of the ROBOTIS-MINI.
- **Voice Recognition** : Use the voice recognition feature of the ROBOTIS-MINI to respond to your voice.
- **Messenger** : Use another smart device to control the ROBOTIS-MINI. It can be connected to another smart device and send commands by a text message.

Below are the functions of each button.
- `Stop Motion` : This button calls on the Motion #0. If this button is pressed during a motion, ROBOTIS-MINI stops after playing current motion unit.
- `Initial Pose` : This button calls on the Motion #1, which is the initial position command. If Motion #1 is modified, it will play the modified motion in Motion #1.
- `Stand Up` : This button calls on the Motion #2, which is the stand up command.  If Motion #2 has been modified, it will run on the modified command.

**NOTE** : When the robot is playing a motion, all other motions except the `Stop Motion` will be ignored.

### Control with Gestures
The `Gesture` tab uses the acceleration sensor of the smart device to command the robot to do certain motions. For example, if the user draws an O or X when holding the smart device, the robot will either walk or sit down based on the assigned motion. This works when the smart device is held straight up 90 degrees to the ground.

- Move the robot by holding your smart device and making a gesture.
