#### The robot makes a continuous warning sound while moving.
- The alarm indicates that the robot is low on batteries.  Immediately recharge your battery(Refer to [Charge](#charge)).
- If you do not replace the battery right away, the robot may turn off without warning and fall, which can cause severe damage.
